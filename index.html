In this Problem set 1; assignment 1, we are tasked to recreate the pyramid of blocks famously shown on Mario 64.

First prompting for user input of Pyramid height, and running a nested for loop with user input to recreate pyramid building blocks.

The next challenge was to then right-align the pyramid.

This was done by pushing its hashes to the right by prefixing them with dots. 
For a pyramid of height 8, the first line has but 1 hash and thus 7 dots. The bottom line, meanwhile, has 8 hashes and thus 0 dots. Via formula (arithmetic) to print respective dots.

Dots were then replaced by spaces.
